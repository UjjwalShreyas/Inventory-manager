# Inventory Management System in C

A beginner-friendly **Command Line Inventory Manager** written in C.  
This project uses **structures + binary file handling** to simulate how real systems manage products in a database.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add products (auto-generated unique IDs ✅)
- View all products in a table
- Search by:
  - Product ID
  - Product Name (case-insensitive)
- Edit product details
- Delete a product
- Low-stock report (default: shows items with quantity < 10)
- Export all data to **CSV** (properly quoted, spreadsheet-ready)

---

## ⚙️ How it Works
- Data is stored in a binary file (`inventory.dat`) as fixed-size `struct product`.
- Editing/deleting follows the classic **temp file rewrite** pattern.
- CSV export uses **quoted fields** to survive commas and quotes inside names.
- Auto-ID is generated by scanning the last used ID and incrementing.
